     <h1>Web Design Experience</h1>

    <div class="details">
      I am in my first year of web design. When I first started the class I didn't know anything about code but through out the semester I have picked up a lot. One of my biggest strengths is making a theme and designing a website based on that theme. One of my better abilites includes animations. I learned to use animation very early in the semester and I have incorporated it into my design for a lot of my projects. One of my weaknesses includes java script. I am very new to it but I am starting to learn how it works more and I am picking up on how to use it.

   <p> In my CSS zen garden project I was able to display my abilities very well. I was able to take a page with no design to a page with a nice fall theme. If you tap the three dots below it will show you what the page looks like with and without css.</p>

     <p> In my imitation project I had taken a magazine cover and had to imitate it using html and css. I spent a lot of time getting everything in the right spot and getting every detail. Other than the font of the word "SLAM" I feel as if it is a near perfect imitation.You can toggle back and forth below to see the originl cover and the imitation.</p>
